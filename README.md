# Karbo Web Wallet - Fully client-side
This web wallet is doing everything client-side to give the best privacy to users.
The server is currently only used to optimize the communication with the daemon and compress the blockchain.  

Note: This requirement may be removed in the future once daemons evolve and return enough data.  

# Security
**No keys, seeds, or sensitive data is sent to the server**  
If you find a potential security issue, please contact me so we/I can patch it as soon as possible.  
Encryption is done with a certified library, [Tweetnacl.Js.](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js)

# Features (non-exhaustive)
- Complete wallet sync without server side processing for security
- Receive/send history
- Mempool support to check incoming transfers
- Send coins - including QR code scanning and subaddress support
- Receive page to generate a custom QR code
- Import from private keys, mnemonic seed, or json file (exported by the wallet)
- Export private keys, mnemonic phrase, or json file (which include all the history)
- View only wallet
- Basic network stats
