# Translating the web wallet 
You can help Masari by translating the wallet into your native language, it's very easy!

# Steps
- Copy/paste the content of [the english translation](src/translations/en.json) in a text editor (Notepad, Word, etc.)
- Translate the parts between quotes that are always after ":"
For example, if you have this: 
```
"disableSecurity":"Disable this security, I understand the risk",
```
- You need to translate: 
```
Disable this security, I understand the risk
```
- If you need to use double quotes (") in your text, please put a \ before it.

# Submitting translations
- Send us your translation by opening an [issue](https://github.com/masari-project/masari-webwallet/issues) on Github or sending it to us directly on the [official Discord](https://discord.gg/eSb9ZdM)
- You can also fork your own repo and make changes, then submit a Pull Request
